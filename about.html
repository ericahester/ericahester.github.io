		<p>I'm a student at Kennesaw State University, obtaining a B.S. in Interactive Design, with minors in Software Engineering and Technical Communication.<br><br>I've been an artist since I was 12, when I discovered my love for drawing and watercolor painting.  I've always had a passion for art, but I chose to study Mechatronics in college since I was also very interested in robotics. However, after taking my first coding class in college, I immediately knew that I had to combine my visual design skills with my newfound love for programming and become an Interaction Designer.</p>
